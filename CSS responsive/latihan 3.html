        Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a
        child is learning enough in homeschool
        because homeschooling generally takes
        much less time than traditional education.
        Homeschooled children generally do not spend
        as much time on a particular topic as traditionally
        educated students because they are neither ahead nor behind their
        classmates. Part of the reason for this is that your
        homeschooled child is receiving one-on-one attention.
        They do not have to wait for others to catch up, nor are
        they holding up other students back if they need to spend
        more time on a topic. If the student understands the topic
        then he or she can move on right away.

        Traditional education is set up for a traditional
         school year, in many states that is approximately 180
         school days. That is, for each subject an hour of
         instruction per day for 180 days, or 180 hours per
         subject. Now, consider this question: Is a public school
         hour of instruction really an hour? Students must move from
         class to class, spending time talking to peers, going to
         lockers, and moving between classrooms and even buildings.
         A traditional school hour of education might be as short as 45
         minutes by the time moving, getting settled, and ready to actually
         learn are taken into account.

        Homeschoolers can take almost all of that transition time out
        of their day. The commute from math at the kitchen table to
        history on the sofa takes considerably less time than moving
        from one end of a building to another and climbing a flight
        of steps or two.  When was the last time you heard of a traditionally
        educated student actually finishing a complete textbook in a year?
        It is safe to say that a homeschooled student can probably cover
        more material in a school day than traditional educated students
        can. It is not unusual for a homeschooled student to complete the
        entire course in a homeschool curriculum.
