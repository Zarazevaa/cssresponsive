          Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a
          child is learning enough in homeschool
          because homeschooling generally takes
          much less time than traditional education.
          Homeschooled children generally do not spend
          as much time on a particular topic as traditionally
          educated students because they are neither ahead nor behind their
          classmates. Part of the reason for this is that your
          homeschooled child is receiving one-on-one attention.
          They do not have to wait for others to catch up, nor are
          they holding up other students back if they need to spend
          more time on a topic. If the student understands the topic
          then he or she can move on right away.
